rm comes up
find most recent main data lock file
load corresponding main data
find most recent prepared transaction lock file
load corresponding list of prepared transactions
for each:
    load transaction data
    if doesn't exist:
        then we must have crashed after deleting data file but before updating
        the list of prepared transactions; this is not a problem
    check status of transaction with middleware
    if committed:
        merge with main data
        persist main data
    delete transaction data file
    write updated prepared transaction list to alternate file
    write lock file for alternate transaction list
