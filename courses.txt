If I do majors math cs:

    required courses (54 credits ~ 18 courses):

        comp 206 - introduction to software systems (F14) !
        comp 250 - introduction to computer science (F14) !
        comp 251 - algorithms and data structures (W15) !
        comp 273 - introduction to computer systems (W15) !
        comp 302 - programming languages and paradigms (W15) !
        comp 310 - operating systems (F15) !
        comp 330 - theory of computation (F15) !
        comp 360 - algorithm design (F15) !
        math 222 - calculus 3 (CEGEP) !
        math 235 - algebra 1 (F14) !
        math 236 - algebra 2 (W15) !
        math 315 - ordinary differential equations (F15) !
        math 318 - mathematical logic (F14) !
        math 242 - analysis 1 (F16)
        math 317 - numerical analysis (F16)
        math 323 - probability (W17)
        math 340 - discrete structures 2 (W16) !

    complementary courses (18 credits ~ 6 courses):

        3 math courses:

            math 370 - honours algebra 3 (F16)
            math 371 - honours algebra 4 (W17)
            + 1 more (ideally: math 430 - mathematical finance)

        3 computer science courses:

            comp 512 - distributed systems (F15) !
            comp 520 - compiler design (W16) !
            comp 527 - logic and commputation (W16) !

    electives (18 credits ~ 6 courses):

        6 courses:

            hgen 396 - human genetics research project (W15) !
            comp 531 - advanced theory of computation (W16) !
            comp 523 - language based security (W17) ?
            - introductory latin (F17 - W18) ?

            + 2 more

    Conclusion:

        I won't have to take honours analysis 2 or honours advanced calculus.

        I can take regular numerical analysis in F16 instead of honours
        numerical analysis in W16.
