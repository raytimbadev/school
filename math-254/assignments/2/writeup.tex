\section*{\# 3 -- The algebraic numbers}

\begin{definition}
    The algebraic numbers $\A \subseteq \R$ are given by the following
    description.

    \begin{equation*}
        \A = \left\{
            x | \exists n \in \N, \exists a \in \Z_*^n :
            \sum_{i=0}^n {a_i x^i} = 0
        \right\}
    \end{equation*}
    where $\Z_*^n$ is defined by $\Z_*^0 = \Z \setminus \{0\}$, and
    $\Z_*^n = \Z^{n-1} \times (\Z \setminus \{0\})$ for $n > 0$.
\end{definition}

Verbally, the algebraic numbers are those reals that can be obtained as a root
of a polynomial of some degree $n$ with integer coefficients.  This definition
involving $Z_*^n$ avoids the possibility of the leading coefficient of the
polynomial being zero.

\begin{prop}
    The algebraic numbers are countable.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    We will write the algebraic numbers as a countable sum, from which it will
    follow that they are countable. Informally, all we have to do is ``pull out
    the existentials'' from our definition of $\A$ to produce the countable
    sum. First, let's pull out the $\exists n \in \N$.
    \begin{equation*}
        \A = \Union_{n=0}^\infty \left\{
            x | \exists a \in \Z_*^n :
            \sum_{i=0}^n {a_i x^i} = 0
        \right\}
    \end{equation*}

    Next, we need to ``pull out'' the $\exists a \in \Z)*^n$.
    \begin{equation*}
        \A = \Union_{n=0}^\infty {
            \Union_{a \in \Z_*^n} \left\{
                x | \sum_{i=0}^n {a_i x^i} = 0
            \right\}
        }
    \end{equation*}
    Note that $\Z_*^n$ is countable because it is the cross product of a finite
    number of countable sets.

    For $n \in \N$ and $a \in \Z_*^n$, $\sum_{i=0}^n {a_i x^n} = 0$ has at
    most $n$ roots, so $\left\{ x | \sum_{i=0}^n {a_i x^i} \right\}$ is finite.
    The countable union of finite sets is countable, so for fixed $n \in \N$,
    $\Union_{a \in \Z_*^n} \left\{ x | \sum_{i=0}^n {a_i x^i} \right\}$ is
    countable.  Hence, $\A$ is countable, since it is a countable union of
    countable sets.
\end{proof}
