\section{Introduction and motivation}

Object-oriented programming is the paradigm of choice for many projects.
Languages in this paradigm are generally backed by large corporations, such as
Microsoft or Oracle, and as such attract many developers seeking lucrative
careers. However, it is not the only paradigm available for the development of
software. Functional programming is increasingly becoming popular for a number
of compelling reasons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item As multicore processors are ubiquitous, concurrent programming is a
    paramount strategy for harnessing the full strength of modern machines. In
    purely functional programming languages, data races are essentially
    impossible to produce, thanks to immutable data and pure functions.

  \item Thanks to powerful type systems offered by modern purely functional
    languages, many useful invariants can be checked statically by the
    compiler. Dependently-typed languages take this even further, by offering
    a first-order logic as a programming language: a compiler for a
    dependently-typed language can guarantee that the arguments to a
    \codesnip{printf} function match its format string, or that a list is
    nonempty. Some functional languages are slowly incorporating features from
    dependently-typed languages. Consequently, myriad errors which manifest
    otherwise only at runtime can be eliminated at compile-time.

  \item By using concepts borrowed from mathematics, functional programming
    languages offer new insights into both classic problems and new problems.
    Specifically, many generalizations of common programming patterns have been
    developed in functional programming languages, which results in improved
    code readability and reuse.
\end{itemize}

With these reasons in mind, we are motivated to design \mcfas{}, a functional
analysis suite for imperative programs. This framework stands in contrast to
\mcsaf{}, which is written in Java and in some aspects difficult to use, for
reasons to be described later. We hope to create a minimal functional framework
as a proof of concept that is pleasant to use and that makes it difficult when
implementing analyses to aim the gun at one's foot.

\section{Background and related work}

Here we will provide a discussion on object-oriented programming versus
functional programming in the context of modelling languages. This is key to
the background of our framework, as \mcfas{} seeks to provide functionality
equivalent to that of an object-oriented static analysis framework. Hence it is
vital to examine what kinds of intrinsic strengths and weaknesses both
paradigms are characterized by, as well as what strategies exist in both
paradigms for patching up those weaknesses.

\subsection{The expression problem} \label{sec:expr}

The expression problem\cite{Wadler1998} is a situation that arises when
modelling languages. It relates the host language's capacity for
\emph{expressivity}. Neither the object-oriented paradigm nor the functional
paradigm fully address the problem: neither one is perfectly expressive. In
fact, each paradigm offers orthogonal benefits when confronted with the
expression problem.

As a simple example, consider the typical example of different types of shapes.
We would like to compute their area. In Haskell, one might write the code in
listing \ref{lst:shapes-area-hs}, and in Java, one might write the code in
listing \ref{lst:shapes-area-java}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Haskell,
  caption={Shapes and area in Haskell.},
  label={lst:shapes-area-hs}
]
data Shape
  = Circle { radius :: Double }
  | Square { side :: Double }

area :: Shape -> Double
area s = case s of
  Circle { radius = r } -> pi * r * r
  Square { side = c } -> c * c
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Java,
  caption={Shapes and area in Java.},
  label={lst:shapes-area-java}
]
interface Shape {
  double getArea();
}

final class Square implements Shape {
  private final double side;

  public Square(final double side) {
    this.side = side;
  }

  public double getArea() {
    return side * side;
  }
}

final class Circle implements Shape {
  private final double radius;

  public Circle(final double radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  public double getArea() {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The expression problem hits us when we want to \emph{extend} this model in some
way. There are essentially two directions in which it can be extended.
\begin{description}
  \item[Horizontally.] We may want to add new types of shapes, which extends
    the \emph{breadth} of our model.
  \item[Vertically.] We may want to add new operations to our shapes, which
    extends the \emph{depth} of our model.
\end{description}

Object-oriented programming makes it easy to extend the model horizontally. To
add a triangle shape, it suffices to create a new class \typename{Triangle}
implementing the \typename{Shape} interface. However, adding a new operation --
say \texttt{perimeter} to the \typename{Shape} interface, i.e. vertically
extending the model, means rewriting every implementation of the interface to
ensure that it implements this new method.

Conversely, functional programming makes it difficult to extend the model
horizontally. Adding a \typename{Triangle} constructor to the \typename{Shape}
datatype will require rewriting every case analysis on the \typename{Shape}
type to account for the new constructor. However, adding a new operation is
trivial: it suffices to write a new function, e.g.
\codesnip{perimeter :: Shape -> Double}.

When analyzing and transforming programs, we deal not in \typename{Shape}s and
\codesnip{area}s but in abstract syntax trees and use-def chains. However, the
essential idea is the there: the breadth of the model is determined by the
language we are modelling, and the depth of the model is determined by the
kinds of analyses and transformations we would like to perform.

\subsubsection{Solution with object-oriented programming}

The \mcsaf{} framework\cite{McSAF} solves the expression problem by using
object-oriented design patterns. Rather than require each node in the abstract
syntax tree to implement the methods necessary for the computation of some
analysis (which would be completely untenable), the code for each individual
analysis is abstracted out into a separate class. However, the logic of an
analysis is fundamentally recursive, as the analysis must traverse the syntax
tree of the program being analyzed. This recursive operation of analysing
different node cases is captured by the \emph{visitor pattern}, in which each
case is identified with a method that is called when that case is reached.

Hence in \mcsaf{} each analysis is a visitor. If the analysis requires state --
practically all interesting analyses do, especially in considering the
formulation of analyses in terms of in-sets and out-sets computed by dataflow
equations -- then the state can be held in the visitor object, and shared
between all case analyses. Certain common analysis patterns such as forward
analyses and backward analyses are given builtin helper classes which
implement the least fixed-point solution algorithm.

\subsubsection{Solution with functional programming}

In the domain of program analysis and transformation, the required direction of
extension for the model is vertical. That is why in the object-oriented
paradigm must resort to specialized implementation techniques like the visitor
pattern -- object-oriented programming is at its core more well suited to
domains that are to be extended horizontally.

In functional programming by contrast, extending the domain vertically is
trivial: each new analysis we wish to implement will be nothing more than a
function. We will give a more detailed explanation of this strategy in section
\ref{sec:strategy}.

For the sake of providing a proper comparison of object-oriented programming
and functional programming in regards to the expression problem, we will show
here how a functional program can be extended horizontally. Using an
implementation technique called Datatypes Ã  la Carte\cite{Swierstra2008}, the
programmer can separate what would normally be separate cases of one datatype
into multiple datatypes.

Consider an expression tree for simple arithmetic expressions, containing
integer constants and addition, as given in listing \ref{lst:arith-naive}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Haskell,
  caption={A straightforward tree for simple arithmetic expressions.},
  label={lst:arith-naive}
]
data Expr
  = Val Int
  | Add Expr Expr

eval :: Expr -> Int
eval e = case e of
  Val n -> n
  Add e1 e2 -> eval e1 + eval e2
\end{lstlisting}

First, we can eliminate explicit recursion in the datatype by extracting its
\emph{signature}, leaving holes where the recursive instances of the type would
go.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
data ExprF e
  = ValF Int
  | AddF e e
\end{lstlisting}

From this signature \codesnip{ExprF} we can recover the original datatype
\codesnip{Expr} by applying a fixpoint. In Haskell, this fixpoint is typically
expressed in the following way.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell]
newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }

type Expr' = Fix ExprF

twoPlusTwo :: Expr
twoPlusTwo = Add (Val 2) (Val 2)

twoPlusTwo' :: Expr'
twoPlusTwo' = Fix (AddF (Fix (ValF 2)) (Fix (ValF 2)))
\end{lstlisting}

Remark: In Haskell, the \codesnip{newtype} construct is a limited kind of
datatype declaration generally used for creating wrapper types. The restriction
is that the wrapper may only contain one field. The compiler optimizes these
single-field datatypes by \emph{completely eliminating} them at runtime, making
wrapping and unwrapping operations have no cost.

The expression \codesnip{twoPlusTwo'} is significantly more cluttered than
\codesnip{twoPlusTwo}, but just by eliminating explicit recursion, the
programmer may use generalized recursion schemes\cite{RecursionSchemes} instead
of writing explicit recursion. Using the recursion scheme formally called a
\emph{catamorphism}, we can recover the \codesnip{eval} function. The function
\codesnip{phi} in listing \ref{lst:cata} is an instance of what is formally
called an \emph{F-algebra}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Haskell,
  label={lst:cata},
  caption={Recovering the evaluation function with a catamorphism.}
]
cata :: Functor f => (f a -> a) -> Fix f -> a
cata phi = phi . fmap (cata phi) . unFix

eval' :: Expr' -> Int
eval' = cata phi where
  phi :: ExprF Int -> Int
  phi e = case e of
    ValF n -> n
    AddF n1 n2 -> n1 + n2
\end{lstlisting}

The first thing that stands out is \codesnip{Functor} and \codesnip{fmap}.
A functor in Haskell is a concept borrowed from category theory. Broadly
speaking, it generalizes the notion of a structure in which an operation can be
performed uniformly without modifying the shape of the structure. The simplest
example is the list structure and the \codesnip{map} operation that applies a
function to each element of the list. The \emph{structure} of the list does not
change: the number of elements in the list remains the same. But each element
was changed somehow.  So whereas the \codesnip{map} function takes a function
$a \to b$ and produces a function $[a] \to [b]$, the \codesnip{fmap} function
takes a function $a \to b$ and produces a function $f a \to f b$, where $f$ is
the functor associated with the particular use of \codesnip{fmap}.

It turns out that \codesnip{ExprF} is a functor! Hence why we chose to append
``F'' to ``Expr''. For the structure that is the expression tree, applying
\codesnip{fmap} to some function $f$ produces a function that operates
differently according to what case is found: if we have \codesnip{ValF n}, we
do nothing; else, if we have \codesnip{AddF e1 e2}, we apply the given function
$f$ to both $e1$ and $e2$.

The next thing to remark about the catamorphism is that in the case
\codesnip{AddF n1 n2}, the bindings \codesnip{n1} and \codesnip{n2} are
integers. This is due to the bottom-up operation of the catamorphism: the part
\codesnip{fmap (cata phi)} of its implementation causes the transformation
\codesnip{phi} to tunnel into the datatype as far as possible, specifically
until a \emph{constant functor} is reached. These constant functors are
specifically the ``do nothing'' cases in the implementation of \codesnip{fmap}
for our functor.

The use of recursion schemes, specifically catamorphisms, was immensely useful
in the development of the Goto\cite{Goto} compiler for GoLite. It allowed the
same syntax tree signature to be used in many stages of the compiler.
Concretely, during typechecking, an annotation wrapper was applied to the
syntax tree signature to produce a type-safe \emph{annotated syntax tree}
datatype. Compilers not using a similar strategy typically embed the typing
annotations wrapped in an option type in the explicitly recursive syntax tree
as illustrated in listing \ref{lst:bad-annotations}.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Haskell,
  label={lst:bad-annotations},
  caption={A syntax tree with explicit annotations.}
]
data Type = Int | String
type Ann = Maybe Type

data AnnExpr
  = ValS Ann String
  | ValI Ann Int
  | Add Ann AnnExpr AnnExpr
\end{lstlisting}

Such a syntax tree with embedded annotations is constructed during parsing by
giving the value \codesnip{Nothing} to all the annotations. During
typechecking, types are determined and filled in. The problem with this
approach is that it does not capture the invariant that prior to typechecking
there is no type information at all, and that after typechecking, every
expression has determined type.

The next step in the Datatypes Ã  la Carte transformation is to split each case
of the \codesnip{ExprF} datatype into its own datatype. Each of these split
datatypes will itself also be a functor. We can recover the joint datatype by
using a construction borrowed also from category theory called a
\emph{coproduct} or \emph{sum}. It turns out that a coproduct of functors is
also a functor. We denote the coproduct of functors $A$ and $B$ as $A + B$.

The final step in the construction requires establishing a sort of subtyping
relation between functors and coproducts, so that the functor $A$ is considered
a ``subtype'' of the coproduct $A + B$.
What this subtyping relation allows one to do is to generically combine a
function $f : F A \to X$ and a function $g : G A \to X$ into a function
$h : (F + G) A \to X$.
Hence, the different cases in the original \codesnip{eval} function become
separate functions which can be mixed and matched to suit the coproduct in
question.
By leveraging Haskell's typeclass-based overloading system, one can avoid
writing the specific boilerplate code required for determining which
combination of functions suits a particular coproduct of functions.
This strategy was used in a very simple just-in-time compiler for
Brainfuck\cite{Fuckdown}.

To recap, object-oriented programming reinvents case analysis via the visitor
pattern in order to support vertical extensibility of the language model.
Conversely, functional programming reinvents subclassing and virtual dispatch
via functor coproducts to support horizontal extensibility of the language
model. We argue that in an analysis framework, we can eschew horizontal
extensibility, instead favouring vertical extensibility: the languages we model
change infrequently, so being able to easily extend the syntax tree is not very
important. There are numerous other strategies that each paradigm can employ to
improve the extensibility of a language model, but we hope that this gives a
sufficient overview of some well-known strategies.

\section{Specific problem statement}

The analysis of programs in object-oriented languages can be cumbersome, if not
outright awkward at times. The use of subclassing as a mechanism for defining
new analyses is inflexible, and very little safety is afforded to a programmer
seeking to write new analyses. Much care must be taken in writing new analyses,
and examination of the source code of the analysis framework is sometimes
necessary in order to understand why an analysis or transformation does not
execute as expected. These obstacles lead to \emph{cargo culting} in which
chunks of code known to be functional are copied around as a substitute for a
proper understanding of the framework's operation.

\section{Solution strategy} \label{sec:strategy}

Our proposed solution is a functional analysis framework for imperative
programs, written in a language with an advanced type system such as Haskell.
We will target a simple imperative language with Matlab-like features, not
unlike the one studied in assignment \#1. We will call this language Oatlab,
since ``O'' comes after ``N'', and oats are delicious.

We can represent the syntax tree of Oatlab as a fixed point of a signature, so
that we can use generalized recursion schemes as the backbone of
transformations in our framework. We can apply a generalized annotation
scheme\cite{Goto} to this signature: the annotations will be used to store user
state associated with each node. Finally, transformations can be written by
the programmer as an F-algebra that reconstructs the transformed tree.

As for analyses, our framework will provide some builtins not unlike McSAF for
common patterns. The major difference is that our framework will use Haskell's
advanced type system to ensure that the functions written by the user touch
only the parts of the syntax tree that our builtin functions expect.
Consequently, a user function cannot break invariants expected by our builtins.

Since the result of an analysis is merely an annotated syntax tree, multiple
analyses can be chained together to build on top of each other. Hence, we can
develop a library of \emph{analysis combinators} which perform common analysis
tasks. A programmer using our framework can then chain together multiple
combinators to form more complex analyses out of simple building blocks. This
strategy is employed with great success in the development of parsers, for
example.

\section{Schedule of activities}

Here we give a breakdown of the work that needs to be done to develop \mcfas{}
and to create the material needed to compare \mcfas{} and \mcsaf{}. We estimate
the time required to complete each of these major steps.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Review and refine the syntax tree annotation strategy employed in
    Goto\cite{Goto}, and adapt it to define the Oatlab syntax tree.
    \emph{Should take one day.}
  \item Write a parser for Oatlab programs. \emph{Should take an afternoon.}
  \item Write a few transformations as F-algebras, to see how it can be
    generalized. \emph{Should take one day.}
  \item Implement the dataflow equation fixed-point solver algorithm, by
    storing the sets in annotations. \emph{Should take a few days.}
  \item Implement a forward and backward analysis in \mcfas{} and \mcsaf{}.
    \emph{Should take a day.}
  \item Investigation and implementation of a small analysis combinator
    library. \emph{Should take a few days.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Expected results and evaluation method}

We expect that analyses and transformations written using our framework be more
concise and less error-prone than similar ones written in \mcsaf{}. These are
both subjective qualities of an analysis: we cannot precisely quantify the
\emph{error-proneness} of a framework.

To decide this, we will perform a qualitative review of some equivalent
analyses implemented in \mcsaf{} and in \mcfas{}. We will discuss possible
mistakes a programmer may make in writing analyses in both frameworks. We will
give a detailed account of the general process for writing analyses in
\mcfas{}, drawing parallels with the work of Jesse Doherty on \mcsaf{}\cite{McSAF}.
